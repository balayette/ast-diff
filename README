Outline:

The GUMTREE algorithm computes mappings from similar nodes of one tree
to another.
The output of the algorithm is then fed into the algorithm of [2].

* [1] Fine-grained and Accurate Source Code Differencing
* [2] Change Detection in Hierarchically Structured Information

Use cases:
* VulPecker: an automated vulnerability detection system based on code similarity analysis

* Generating simpler AST edit scripts by considering copy-and-paste

* Renaming and shifted code in structured merging: looking ahead for precision and performance

Building clang-sexpression:

$ ln -s $PWD/clang-sexpression $PATH_TO_LLVM_PROJECT/clang-tools-extra/clang-sexpression
$ echo 'add_subdirectory(clang-sexpression)' >> $PATH_TO_LLVM_PROJECT/clang-tools-extra/CMakeLists.txt

Make sure that your enabled the clang-tools-extra project when you ran cmake in the llvm project.
