Outline:

ast-diff is a tool that computes the difference between two trees.
ast-diff can read trees from files or the standard input, in s-expression
format.

A clang-based tool to generate C/C++ s-expressions : https://github.com/d1adev/clang-sexpression

ast-diff uses the Gumtree algorithm to compute mappings from nodes of a tree
to nodes of another tree.

Usage:

42sh$ make
42sh$ ./ast-diff --diff test/while.sexp test/for.sexp
Similarity: 0.4242

The similarity metric is contained in the [0, 1] interval.
